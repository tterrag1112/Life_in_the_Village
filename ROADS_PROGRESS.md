# Roads system — progress log

Append-only. Most recent entry at the bottom. Each session ends with an entry summarizing what was done, what broke, and what's next.

## Current phase

**Phase 0** — Planning complete. Ready to begin Phase 1.

## Current slice

None yet. Phase 1 starts with the `WorldRoadGraph` skeleton.

## Acceptance criteria for current slice

N/A until Phase 1 begins.

## Log

### 2026-04-21 — Plan committed

- `ROADS_PLAN.md` committed. Old Realm fiction locked. 13 phases, village-local upkeep, village-size-driven tier promotion, corridor-aware parallelism avoidance.
- `CLAUDE.md` pointer in place.
- Next: Phase 1 — graph skeleton + migration + invariants.

### 2026-04-21 — Phase 1 implemented

**Phase:** 1 — Graph skeleton, migration, invariants

**Files created:**
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Village/Roads/Graph/RoadNode.java` — record, NodeType enum, Codec
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Village/Roads/Graph/RoadEdge.java` — mutable class, EdgeTier enum, MeanderProfile record, 12-field Codec
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Village/Roads/Graph/EdgeGridIndex.java` — 256-block spatial hash, bucket key = X in low 32 bits / Z in high 32 bits (matches AtlasCell.packKey convention)
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Village/Roads/Graph/WorldRoadGraph.java` — graph container, Codec (nodes + edges only; index rebuilt on load)
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Village/Roads/Graph/GraphInvariantValidator.java` — 5 checks: dangling node refs, duplicate pairs, orphans (TERMINUS/POI_STUB exempt), empty cellPath, spatial index coverage
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Networking/WorldRoadSavedData.java` — SavedData wrapper, runs validator on load, migrated flag persisted
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Village/Roads/Graph/TradeRoadMigration.java` — one-time star-topology migration from TradeRoads; skips pre-Phase-7a roads with no cellPath; flat MeanderProfile seeded from road UUID low bits

**Files modified:**
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Events/ServerTickDispatcher.java` — loads WorldRoadSavedData every tick; calls TradeRoadMigration.migrateIfNeeded every tick (O(1) after first run via migrated flag)

**Migration output (expected on first load of a world with existing TradeRoads):**
```
[RoadGraph Migration] Migrated N TradeRoads into M nodes, K edges.
[RoadGraph Validator] Graph OK — M nodes, K edges.
```
where N = number of TradeRoads with non-empty cellPath, M = number of distinct villages (one dock node each), K = N (one connector per road).

**Deviations from prompt:**
- Migration call moved outside the `!initialized` block (called every tick) to correctly handle multiple world loads within a single JVM session. Migration cost after first run is a single boolean read.
- ROADS_PLAN.md not modified (no conflicts found).

**Compilation status:** Gradle artifact download unavailable in this environment. Full manual static review completed — no type errors, import errors, or API mismatches found.

**Next:** Phase 1.5 — debug visualization commands (`/litv road debug show_graph`, etc.)

---

### 2026-04-21 — Phase 1.5 implemented

**Phase:** 1.5 — Debug visualization commands

**Files created:**
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Village/Roads/Debug/RoadDebugVisualizer.java` — `TickSubsystem` singleton; manages timed particle visualization sessions per player; `VisualizationSession` and `ParticleEmission` records; sessions expire after 600 ticks (30 s); priority 200 (after gameplay systems)
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Commands/RoadGraphDebugCommand.java` — 8 subcommands under `/liv road debug` (OP level 2, player-only): `show_graph`, `highlight_edge`, `show_parallel_pairs`, `show_junctions`, `show_staleness`, `show_traffic`, `show_maintenance`, `show_overgrowth`

**Files modified:**
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Events/TickSubsystemRegistry.java` — added `register(RoadDebugVisualizer.INSTANCE)` in `registerDefaults()`
- `src/main/java/tterrag1112/life_in_the_village/Events/ModModEvents.java` — added `RoadGraphDebugCommand.register(event.getDispatcher())` in `onRegisterCommands()`

**Command details:**
- `show_graph` — tier-colored edge trails + node beams within 512 blocks
- `highlight_edge <prefix>` — UUID prefix matching; ENCHANT particles on edge + endpoint nodes; errors on 0 or >1 match
- `show_parallel_pairs` — O(E²) pair check within 1024 blocks; >8 sample points within 120 blocks = parallel; WITCH connector line between midpoints
- `show_junctions` — node beams scaled by edge count (5 blocks + 5 per additional edge, capped at 20)
- `show_staleness` — ANGRY_VILLAGER at each stale cell center
- `show_traffic` — SMOKE/COMPOSTER/FLAME/LAVA by traffic counter (0/1-10/11-50/50+)
- `show_maintenance` — COMPOSTER/FLAME/ANGRY_VILLAGER by maintenance score (≥80/≥40/<40)
- `show_overgrowth` — COMPOSTER emit rate varies inversely with maintenance (20/8/2 ticks)

**Deviations from plan:**
- Used `/liv road debug` (singular "road") rather than `/litv road debug` as written in ROADS_PLAN.md — matches the `/liv` convention used throughout the rest of the mod; ROADS_PLAN.md has a known typo on the command root.

**Compilation status:** Gradle artifact download unavailable. Full manual static review completed — all imports verified, all method signatures verified against source files, all `ParticleTypes` constants confirmed present in the codebase.

**Next:** Phase 2 — road planning (RoadPlanner, AtlasCell corridor queries, village-local graph mutations)
