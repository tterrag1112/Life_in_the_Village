# UNIFIED REWORK PROGRESS

Append-only log. Most recent entry at bottom.

Status values: `Not-Started`, `In-Progress`, `Implemented`, `Tested`,
`Done`. `Done` means: implemented, tested in-world, no known issues,
spec matches reality.

## Carryover from absorbed plans (not re-tracked here)

- NPC Phase 5 task 33 (textures) — `NPC_PROGRESS.md`.
- NPC Phase 5 task 34 (content pass) — `NPC_PROGRESS.md`.
- NPC deferrals (Office tab GUI, Quest→Request migration, GuildData
  rename, Refugee leader UI, OfficeChange emission, etc.) —
  `NPC_PROGRESS.md`.

## Log

### 2026-05-07 — Plan committed

Unified plan written. All four tracks defined. No code changes yet.

Next: A1 — V1 cleanup + ZoneRegistry migration.

### 2026-05-08 — A1a wired

Renamed Track A1 → A1a (wire V2 in parallel) + A1b (delete V1) per
prompt direction. V1 deletion now sequenced after A2/A3 stabilize.

**Code shipped:**
- `Village/Planning/V2/V2Settings.java` — volatile boolean flag,
  default false, runtime-toggleable.
- `Village/Planning/V2/V2VillageSpawnerAdapter.java` — full adapter:
  runs V2 Layers 1-4 (V2FeatureMap → SiteAnalyzer → BuildingSelector
  → ReconciliationEngine → DependencyResolver → PhasedPlanner),
  inlines Layer-5 sub-components (OverlapAuditor, TerrainAdapter,
  ViabilityValidator, VegetationClearer, PadBuilder, RoadPainter)
  while capturing Building references from `BuildingPlacer.placeAndRegister`,
  synthesizes a minimal `VillageLayout`, registers a `Village` in
  `VillageSavedData`, and runs the V1 downstream pipeline
  (FarmPlotPlacer, VillageInhabitantPopulator, VillageDecorator,
  AdjunctPlotRealiser, DecorationPass, TradeRouteManager,
  ConnectorPlanner, VillageSimEngine, GuildBootstrap, HistoryProducer,
  initial laws). Each downstream call is `guard()`-wrapped so a single
  failure logs and does not abort the spawn.
- `Commands/ConfigCommand.java` — `/litv config adaptive_v2 <on|off|status>`.
- `Events/ModModEvents.java` — registered `ConfigCommand`.
- `Village/VillageSpawner.java` — flag-checked branch after
  `VillageTypeData` resolution; V1 path otherwise unchanged.

**Step 3 gaps the V2 path does NOT replicate:**

Items V1 produces that V2 does not (the synth VillageLayout fills
defaults; downstream consumers tolerate or are guarded):
- `Plaza` records (V1 plaza system; V2 has no plaza concept).
- V1 `RoadGraph` populated with gateway nodes / internal edges
  (V2 `RoadNetwork` is a different shape; `GatewayPopulator` and
  `InternalRoadCommitter` are NOT called on V2 path).
- `VillagePlacementEvent` firing (Roads Phase 9 network-alignment
  scoring; intentionally skipped — wire later if Roads consumers
  need it).
- `setupMerchantStalls` (V1 private helper; not callable from
  adapter; merchant stalls will not auto-claim on V2 path).
- `VillageSitePreparer.prepare` whole-village tree clearing
  (V2 does per-building `VegetationClearer` instead).
- `typeData.getTerrainStrategy().execute` whole-village terrain pass
  (V2 does per-building `PadBuilder` instead).
- `findBetterLocalSite` retry on planner failure (V2 returns empty
  on UNVIABLE; no retry).
- `layout.getFeatures().refine(level)` Phase-4 feature-map refine
  (V2 has its own `V2FeatureMap`; the synth layout's V1 FeatureMap
  field stays null).

Field-level mismatches:
- `Style` always RURAL on V2 path. URBAN pack (P0a-16) will not
  surface through V2 until A3 unification or a culture-driven style
  hint lands.
- `villageType` argument is recorded on the resulting `Village` but
  V2 ignores it for layout, building selection, and viability —
  V2 derives those from terrain. `FarmPlotPlacer.placeAll` reads
  `village.getVillageType()` for its config; the caller must pass a
  registered type or FarmPlotPlacer will NPE under the guard.
- `TintPass.Plan.NONE` always on V2 path (no `VariantRegistry` /
  `VillagePaletteResolver` integration; deferred to A3).
- `LayoutSlot.padY` set to V2 `centre.getY()` (surface block);
  may need +1 if a downstream consumer treats padY as the building
  floor — re-evaluate on smoke-test feedback.

Adapter-design decisions worth recording:
- Did NOT call `MinimalSpawner.spawn` directly — its sub-components
  are called inline so Building references can be captured for
  `placedBuildingsAll`. `MinimalSpawner` itself drops them. No V2
  internals were modified.
- Single Random seeded `level.getSeed() ^ ((origin.hashCode() * 31L) +
  villageName.hashCode())` so V2 path is reproducible per (seed,
  origin, name) like V1.
- Static field + `/litv config` chosen over `ModConfiguration.java`
  Properties extension or NeoForge `ModConfigSpec` — runtime
  toggleability is cheapest with the static field.
- Track renumbering (A1 → A1a / A1b) deviates from
  `UNIFIED_REWORK_PLAN.md` text; plan is human-managed and that
  deviation should be reflected if it sticks.

**Smoke test:** pending user-run on superflat. Expected behavior:
- `adaptive_v2=false`: V1 path unchanged; existing world saves keep
  loading.
- `adaptive_v2=true`: village created via V2 with buildings placed,
  roads painted, NPCs spawned via VillageInhabitantPopulator;
  decoration / trade / sim / guild / history / laws guarded — log
  warnings if any of them fail rather than aborting the spawn.

Compile verification not possible in this environment (gradle
toolchain plugin requires network the sandbox blocks; same issue
recorded across NPC_PROGRESS.md).

Next: smoke-test feedback. Then A2 (Culture unification).
